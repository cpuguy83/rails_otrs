This app is a bridge between the OTRS API and Rails.
You can use this to connect to the OTRS API in a more RESTful way.
This is still a work in development and only partial functionality has been added.

Items to clean up
 - Finish making tickets/articles/links create/update methods more ActiveRecord like

Partially implemented
  - Tickets API
  - Articles API
  - Links API
  - ITSM ConfigItems API
  

To customize for your use you must have the OTRS json.pl in your OTRS cgi-bin directory.
I also added ITSMConfigItemObjects to this json as it is required for my use.
I will create an OPM package with a custom json.pl to do it the right way (instead of editing existing files directly, causing errors in the admin interface).
In app>models>otrs.rb you need to change the username/password, host, and URL to whatever matches your installation.
The username/password combo should be an existing agent in OTRS.



You can either copy the app files to your existing rails app or run this as a separate service and connect your Rails app using ActiveResource.
Check out http://railscasts.com/episodes/94-activeresource-basics as a primer to using ActiveResource.
